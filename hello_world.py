You are designing IoT device to track voluntary cyclists, to find out what kind of routes are popular in the city and 
its suburban areas. Your device will send regular updates of cyclistâ€™s location and later you hope you can add some 
other sensors to collect more detailed data throughout the route. Your device has very limited data storage capabilities.
 During the process you must decide, what radio technology you will use for communication. From the following, which 
 would be most suitable for your use case: 
Select one:
1.NB-IoT 
2.Sigfox 
3.ZigBee
4.Z-Wave

6LoWPAN devices can perform native IPv6 communication without any assistance with remote IPv6 hosts.
Select one:

1.True, however, it must be joined with CoAP on transport layer 

2.True, 6LoWPAN compresses IPv6 header files to make the communication possible 

3.False, 6LoWPAN border router is needed to facilitate communication between 6LoWPAN hosts and traditional IPv6 host 

4.False, all constrained devices are not IPv6 capable, so IPv6 communication is impossible.
